# Kitchen Chemistry


### Do you know what's hot and what's not?

In Kitchen Chemistry, you have to select which of the chemicals listed is a harmless food item. Don't pick the wrong ingredient, or you might poison your guests! These guests are hungry, too, so you'll only have a little time to make your choice. Good Luck!
